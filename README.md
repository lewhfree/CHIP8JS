# CHIP8JS
### TODO
-  A couple of the FX** instructions
-  Some misc. debugging
-  The memory dump button doesn't work, and the register dump button I would like to have it put into a table.
-  Stepping through the program.

### Examples
Look up "chip-8 programs" on google. <br>
Or use breakout.ch8 included in the repo
