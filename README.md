# CHIP8JS
### TODO
-  A couple of the FX** instructions
-  Some misc. debugging
-  The memory dump button doesn't work, and the register dump button I would like to have it put into a table.
-  Stepping through the program.
-  Sound (The timer works, I just haven't hooked it up to the speakers)
  <br>
  
### Examples
Look up "chip-8 programs" on google. <br>
Or use breakout.ch8 included in the repo (I think it's the Q and E keys that move the paddle)
<br>

### How to Use
Upload a program using the file selector. <br>
Lots of programs will run themselves, but for user input use: <br>
1 (1) 2 (2) 3 (3) 4 (C) <br>
q (4) w (5) e (6) r (D) <br>
a (7) s (8) d (9) f (E) <br>
z (A) x (0) c (B) v (F) <br>
You can just look up a chip-8 keypad online. It uses the left 16 keys on the keyboard. <br>
